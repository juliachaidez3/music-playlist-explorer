### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I did not feel very prepared after the lessons and labs. To do the project I felt like I needed a lot of outside help. It felt very rushed, but the in class demos by the instructors were helpful.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have worked on cleaning up my code. I think I could have condense some of the CSS and used better naming for my classes, varaibles, etc., but I was short on time. I really wish I could have implemented some of the stretch features like the search bar or sort because they would make it feel more like a functioning website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

For my presentation I need to work on not talking to my computer! I should set back and really take my time to explain my website/code before jumping right into the demo. I liked that my peers were very open about the things they did well on and the things they struggled with. I also enjoyed seeing everyone add their own personal style to the website.
